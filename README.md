# Solar-System-Model
A 3D Model of the Solar System was created using Javascript and the Three.js Library. Using the “a” and “d” keys you can move the camera from side to side. The “q” and “e” keys change the zoom. Additionally you can click on any of the planets  shown on the page which will focus the camera on that particular planet you clicked on. In this mode you can also use the “a” and “d” to move the camera from side to side. The “ESC” button will take you back to the view of the Solar System.
